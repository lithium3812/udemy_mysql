## Mid and Final projects of Udemy SQL course

These files are SQL scripts for mid and final projects I worked on in the Udemy SQL course "MySQL for Data Analysis - SQL Database for beginners" by Maven Analytics:

The file "create-mavenmovies.sql" is a script to create virtual customers and inventory data.
